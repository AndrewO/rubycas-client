= RubyCAS-Client Changelog

== Version 0.10.2

* Added this changelog to advise users of major changes to the library.
* service and targetService parameters in requests are now properly URI-encoded,
  so the filter should behave properly when your service has query parameters.
* If your service URI has a 'ticket' parameter, it will now be automatically
  removed. This is done because at least some CAS servers will happily accept
  a service URI with a 'ticket' parameter, which will result in a URI with 
  multiple 'ticket' parameters once you are redirected back to CAS (and that in
  turn can result in an endless redirection loop).
* Logging has been greatly improved, which should make debugging your CAS
  installation much easier. Look for the logs under log/cas_client_RAILS_ENV.log
* When you install RubyCAS-Client as a Rails plugin, it will now by default
  use a custom logger. You can change this by explicitly setting your own
  logger in your environment.rb, or by modifying the plugin's init.rb.
* CasProxyCallbackController no longer checks to make sure that the incoming
  request is secure. The check is impossible since the secure header is not 
  passed on by at least some reverse proxies (like Pound), and if you are using
  the callback controller then you are almost certainly also using a reverse
  proxy.
* Cleaned up and updated documentation, fixed some example code.
